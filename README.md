Kernel Info:

DO NOT USE ANY PERFORMANCE (CPU/GPU/ETC) MAGISK MODULES WITH THIS FOR BEST PERFORMANCE!!!
IT INSTALLS IT'S OWN OPTIMIZED MAGISK MODULE AUTOMATICALLY

Features: 835mhz GPU, Adreno Boost (flar2), Dynamic Fsync (Faux123), Lord Boeffla WL blocker (andip71) (better battery idle), F2FS optimizations, LZ4 ZRAM. EXFAT USB/SDCard support added. Sultan Boost (SultanXDA) + PapaSmurf's (pappschlumpf) Op7Pro tweaks, Dynamic Overclocking + Underclocking with frequency boost for smooth, fast, clean performance and fluid scaling.

Just use the Magisk Module it installs for you automatically when you flash the zip from TWRP, likely the best results will be obtained.
SmartPack can be installed to choose between profiles under Performance Tweaks - battery / balanced / performance / gaming, although the default installed Magisk module is highly recommended by itself for optimal performance and good battery drain.
